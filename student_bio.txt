"My name is Vitalii Kozak. I was born in Lviv, Ukraine. My dad is Andrew, and my mother is Olena. 
Our family also has a dog called Dina. I am studying at Lviv Polytechnic National University(LPNU) 
in the faculty of measurement technologies. I am very intrigued by Physics, Engineering, and Programming, 
so that`s why I am eager to learn more about Machine Learning and other exciting technologies, 
which can be tremendously helpful for humankind. Also i like music, different sports activities
(calisthenics, volleyball, soccer, basketball, and so on). 
Plus I really take pleasure in traveling and hiking in the mountains."
